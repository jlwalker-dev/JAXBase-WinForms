# JAXBase-WinForms
Early dev of JAXBase V1 for Windows only
  
## Important Notice
This is an early, work-in-progress prototype / migration staging area for JAXBase.<br>
This version is Windows-only (WinForms-based) and is not the official release version.<br>
The new version is using the free Avalonia framework to make it Windows/Linux/Mac compatible.<br>
This code is experimental, incomplete, and is now largely obsolete - Intended for development discussion and conversion planning only.<br>

If you really want to download it, feel free as it is open-source.<br><br>

See the main [repo](https://github.com/jlwalker-dev/JAXBaseV1) and [wiki](https://github.com/jlwalker-dev/JAXBaseV1/wiki_) for the current source, project overview, language specs, and roadmap.
