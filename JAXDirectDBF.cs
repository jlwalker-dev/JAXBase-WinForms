 * HISTORY
 * =======================
 *  2025 -01-21 - JLW
 *      This is the start of my converting the old QuickBASIC system that I wrote in the 
 *      last century.  The plan is to bring forward the FoxBase2 data capabilities and then 
 *      upgrade to as recent of a version that I can find documentation on.  My intent/wish 
 *      is to support all the way up to VFP Version 9 and then add JAX extensions.
 *      
 *      VFP has the ability to buffer records and return row/column changes.  I think that 
 *      may belong in the DataSessions class.  This class should just read/write records 
 *      and deal with indexes.
 *      
 *      The QB system was quite fast, and I have great hopes some of that speed can translate 
 *      into C#.
 *  
 *  2025-02-06 - JLW
 *      I have tied the JAXDirectDBF in with the new DataSession code and tested it out.  
 *      Opened a DBF and read a data record successfully.  I'll be updating the test code to 
 *      also write a new record.  I'll eventually finish the (big) task of creating and 
 *      updating an IDX.
 *      
 *      Then I need to figure out how to share the files and handle locking to write.
 *      I've started that by opening the files in ReadWrite/Shared mode.
 *      I'll also need to check into BinaryWrite to see if I need to rewrite anything as 
 *      C# has ways of writing data that MIGHT be compatible with how data is stored in 
 *      a DBF.
 *      
 *  2025-04-01 - JLW
 *      Have come to an agreement with Vertican and I've used the time to reseach IDX
 *      file creation.  I'm going to tear apart a indexes using the docs they've
 *      supplied.
 *  
 *  2025-04-02 - JLW
 *      I've downloaded a couple of projects from GitHub but the people who work on them 
 *      are obviously geniuses, because they have virtually no comments in the code and 
 *      the variable and method names are AWFUL!  How the hell do they work on that crap?
 *      I've got code to show me how to create CDX files and I'm having one hell of a time
 *      reading it.  I do see a some interesting things, like how it appears they have 
 *      clases for nearly everything.  Deciphering the logic is just crazy hard as I really
 *      don't know C++ and, again, no documentation worth talking about.
 *      
 *      
 *  2025-04-04
 *      Creating an index is coming along and I have the split node mostly logic figured out 
 *      along with keeping everything in order and linking the nodes together   After tearing 
 *      apart a small index VFP created, I've confirmed that VFP does things differently 
 *      during the build, and probably with less code/logic (definitely faster), but I'll 
 *      worry about optimizing later.  I'm trying keep the code simple and readable.  The
 *      biggest thing I saw was that a root node can also be a leaf node.  I'm glad to see
 *      that because I really wanted to do just that and it just confirms I can.  Tearing
 *      apart an index is of limited utility for the most part, it's pretty much along
 *      the lines of everything I remember reading about indexing when I worked on the QB 
 *      code in the last century.  Damn, I wish I had continued that project when there were
 *      engineers and coders that would have had interest.  I could have posted some real 
 *      decent questions on StackOverflow and gotten answers that aren't "Why are you still 
 *      working with VFP?"
 *      
 *      Right now, I only create a Leaf Node Right by splitting the current leaf node and
 *      then linking everything up.  I'm pretty sure I saw evidence that VFP has the ability 
 *      to create an empty node to the left when I tore those cople of indexes apart. I think 
 *      I'm going to not do that. I think doing a split makes more sense because you don't 
 *      know what's coming.  Why create a node left with one record when you may not need it?  
 *      Doing a split and updating the correct leaf could potentially save code, time, and 
 *      space.  Perhaps I'm missing something, but I'm not an MS engineer, so I'll go with 
 *      what I know.  I remember reading about some of this and can recall a bunch of the
 *      concepts, but unfortunately I tossed those books a long time ago (damed idiot).
 *      
 *      Anyway, it removes the need for Add Node Left logic.  That means I just need to add
 *      a Split Index Right which should also handle the Split Root Node right scenario.
 *      Or I could create a new root and make the old root into an index node. Will need to 
 *      think about that.  If I do, I can optimize the Add Leaf Node Right logic a bit.
 *      
 *      If I do that, the root needs to be able to start anywhere in the file, just like the
 *      docs imply.  I'm also going to have to think hard on the free node list. Do I reuse 
 *      nodes or just reindex when I get a certain number of free nodes built up?  If I reuse 
 *      them, it will be dead last, just before I tackle the CDX index types.  Probaly best
 *      if I do, but I'll have to let it cook for a while.
 *      
 *  2025-04-06 - JLW
 *      Looking back at those original indexes I tore apart, I suddenly figured out 
 *      how the index information is being saved for numeric, date, integer, and datetime.
 *      It's done just like in the DBF except backwards and upside down (LOL).
 *      Fortunately, I'm not always and idiot and can sometimes see the obvious.  Also 
 *      read that varchars can be put into an IDX so I threw in a global that is set 
 *      when you want to make an IDX expression that is for a char or varchar field, it 
 *      returns a space filled string equal of the field's full width.  The other data 
 *      types are all fixed at 4 or 8 characters, so nothing to worry about there.
 *      
 *      As for how the non-character data is stored in an index is simplicity in itself.
 *      If you create switch the negative/positive sign, create a byte array the same way
 *      as saving it to the dbf, then you have a value that is very small for the lowest
 *      negative value and very large for the highest allowed positive value.  It's just
 *      taking advantage with how negative and postitive numeric values are created.
 *      
 *      Building the index down the left whenever possible, and filling in the full
 *      branch before moving right seems to be the way to use the least amount of code.
 *      Whenever something splits, it's:
 *      
 *          To the right, ever to the right.  Never to the left, forever to the right.
 *          (Come sing Hosanna, Hosanna...We cool, cool men)
 *      
 *  2025-04-10 - JLW
 *      I now have an IDX creation for string and numeric indexes and VFP9 can use them. 
 *      Whenever it complains, I tear my index apart looking for the missing pointer,
 *      lost record, or zero filled position.  Once it complained about the last
 *      leaf not having a -1 in the right pointer.  No sense of humor at all!
 *      
 *      It's not  creating an index exactly like the VFP indexes I first looked at, but 
 *      it's definitely compatible and I'm pretty happy with the logic.  Sometimes the 
 *      indexes are identical, but not often.  The early tests showed that MS would not 
 *      split the node in half.  I like my logic better as it means it won't create
 *      another node around those leaves until one of them are filled up.
 *
 *      I'll be testing the others in the coming days.  I do not really see a problem 
 *      finishing this off.  I'm sure I'll run into several gotchas, but mostly I just need
 *      to make sure I follow the docs.  
 *      
 *      After that I'll tackle updating and creating new records with open IDX files.
 *      
 *      
 *  2025-04-12
 *      The IDX creation is SLOW.  OMG it's like DBase 2 on an 8088 floppy disk slow!  
 *      I've determined that the problem is all of the disk writes I'm forced to perform.  
 *      I've also realized that I can index 100,000 records of 100 bytes each, in memory, 
 *      for a bit over 10mb.  So I rewrote a new creation code block and do it in memory.  
 *      It's so much faster.  Not VFP fast, but quite respectable.  I'm keeping the code 
 *      I originally wrote because it will update an index one record at a time, which is 
 *      what you need once the index is built and you start performing CRUD operations on
 *      the table.
 *      
 *  2025-04-14 - JLW     
 *      Adding $Changes field to the DBFInfo field list for all tables, views, & cursors 
 *      when they are opened so that they all act the same, except that non-buffered tables 
 *      will not give useful results.  Of course, I have not yet begun the table buffering 
 *      logic.  Buffering will probably come after I attempt to recreate CDX files as I need 
 *      to let that cook in my head for a while, yet.  I don't see any real problem with 
 *      buffering views and cursors, but I need to think through tables before tackling it.
 *      
 *      Again, I wish there was more documentation on DBF internals.
 *      
 *  2025-04-15 - JLW
 *      I AM AN IDIOT!  Just before going asleep last night, I realized that I'm doing more
 *      work than I need to when I do a split.  Right now I'm creating a new node and
 *      dropping the bottom half of the current node into the new node and updating the
 *      key for the old node in the node above.  WHY????  If I drop the top half of
 *      the current node into the new node, then I only need to add a new reference
 *      and not have to change anything else!  stupid, Stupid, STUPID!
 *      
 *  2025-04-17 - JLW
 *      Added final resting point to the IDXCommand so that I know what leaf and leaf record
 *      holds the reference to the current record.  Very usefull in SKIP, and INSERT commands.
 *      
 *      Also created IDXUpdateRecPosPlusOne() to update the index as quickly as possible after
 *      a record INSERT isn't an append to the dbf.
 *      
 *      Also prototyped the DBFPack() routine.  Pretty simple once I put my mind to it.  Again,
 *      the biggest thing is not not read from or write tp the disk for every record.  Grab
 *      100 records, process them in memory, write, rinse, repeat.
 *
 *
 *  2025-04-19 - JLW
 *      Realized I was doing more work than needed.  GOTO is always to the specified physical record
 *      except when TOP or BOTTOM is given, which is the top/bottom of the index if one is active.
 *      Tossed a bunch of code out and happy about that. Walking the nodemap to GOTO the next index
 *      position was interesting, but completely unneeded.  Kept the code in case I want to come up
 *      with an idea for a new command.
 * 
 *      With the excess code pulled, traversing the index is now a lot easier.  Especially for a skip.
 *      I'm also going to rip out the extra properties I added to the index related classes since they
 *      are now unneeded or redundant.  The nodemap will hold pretty much everything I'll need.
 * 
 *  2025-04-25 - JLW
 *      Copied to the JAXBase system
 *  
 *  2025-05-05 - JLW
 *      Early testing shows that double values are not getting passed out of the data table
 *      correctly.  18174.17 will equal 18174.16920123 or similar when passed into a toekn.
 *      The only fix seems to be either using the field information to round the values
 *      or storing the values as a string and converting when I need them.  Going to have
 *      to think this through very carefully.
 *      
 * 2025-07-07 - JLW
 *      Updated the system to only load memo field pointers unless a flag is set to true in
 *      the parameters.  Also set up a memo JAXMemo class that is used to improve handling
 *      of memo fields.  Since the datatable is not directly written to or read from
 *      the dbf, we can replace the datatypes with classes.  I think when I get into the C++
 *      code, that there will definitely be some rethinking of code to improve data handling
 *      and this might be needed to make buffering work (I still have no clue how I'll do that
 *      but I'm sure I'll figure out something when I put my mind to it).
 *      
 * 2025-07-15 - JLW
 *      I'm good enough for now.  Going to debug as I move forward with other parts of the
 *      system.
 *      
 * 2025-08-16 - JLW
 *      I've collected enough information to start working on lock/unlock and shared/exclusive.
 *
 * 2025-09-25 - JLW
 *      Came up with a way to make sure an index belongs to a table.  JAXBase tables will
 *      have a 36 character GUID license and indexes will need to match that license.
 *
